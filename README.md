This repository should be used as a general reference for the analysis pipeline used for the MEMSEAL DARPA project.

As more scripts are added, they should be numbered roughly in the order they are run in the pipeline.

If there are alternative or parallel processes at a given step, a letter should be included (as in step3A, step3B).

The entire analysis in this project include various 'Omics inputs, so eventually this repository will be subdivided for each pipeline.

At present, this repository is jointly maintained by Chris Boughter & Budha Chatterjee.
